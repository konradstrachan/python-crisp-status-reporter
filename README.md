# python-crisp-status-reporter
Simple example showing how to submit status information to Crisp in Python3

Crisp Status Reporter is used to submit health information to Crisp Status from apps. Crisp provide official libraries for node, go and rust but not python.

Since the documentation was a little unclear and I had to seek support from Crisp to make a python reporter work, I'm sharing the resulting minimum code to help others.
